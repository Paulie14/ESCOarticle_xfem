Dear Pavel Solin,

We wish to submit a new manuscript entitled 
“Partition of unity methods for approximation of point water sources in~porous media” 
for possible publication in "Applied Matematics and Computation" journal in special issue ESCO 2014.
We confirm that this work is original and has not been published elsewhere nor it is currently under consideration for publication elsewhere.

This paper is devoted to the application of the partition of unity methods (PUM) on the groundwater flow problem 
in order to resolve singularities appearing around wells. We perform comparison of four slightly different PUM
in terms of convergence and conditioning. We perform analysis of the quadrature error and influence of the 
enriched domain on the solution error. 

This work further develops results due to R. Gracie and J. Craig, the only work concerning the usage of XFEM to the well problems.
Original contribution of the manuscript covers: detailed tests of convergence, 
comparison of different methods, better quadrature strategy, and discussion of the role of the enriched domain.
